# Feasibility Study of Microfluidic Circuit by Simulation


**Project Description**
A Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) designed to facilitate the simulation of microfluidic circuits. The GUI was developed using the Tkinter module and aims to simplify the parametrization process for microfluidic circuit simulations.

The GUI serves as an interface for:

* Displaying component information.
* Editing component information.
* Drawing the microfluidic circuit.
* Running simulations and displaying results.

## Features
* Component Display: View detailed information about each component in the circuit.
* Component Editing: Modify the parameters of the components directly through the interface.
* Circuit Drawing: Intuitive tools to draw and design the microfluidic circuit.
* Simulation Results: Display the results of the simulation, including flow rates and pressures.
